Your documents and your administrative procedures, everywhere, on one click !

# Objective :
- Are you not tired of always updloading the same document and information for all your online administrative procedures ? What about never doing it again ?

AuthGov provides you a secure way of loggin to any of your government website.
By assuring your identity with AuthGov, the governement provides all document stocked on their database to any procedure. 
For all other document missing, like proof of address, AuthGov provides you with a secure locker to store all your documents. 
Whenever you need to send an administrative document to complete a form .

# Technology :
In order to do so, we implemented:
  -Storage of your files in a decentralized way: the BlockChain
  -Offer connection to all of you government instance via our WebApp
  -A unique way of loggin to our service to prove your identity, by using a hardware key and robust encryption algorithms
  - A place to keep all your important files in the same place so you can have them at all time 
 
# Storage :
As the uncle of Peter Parker said, "With great power comes great responsibility", that is why we decided to let you be the main character by using smart contracts as storage !
This decentralised storage allows you be the only one to interact with your personal documents, like bills or id, access it, and change it ! 
Smart Contracts allow a great security, but you have to be responsible with your private key and password...
Also, even if Ethereum Blockchain is a little bit polluting, it is still better than cutting tons of trees for these paper documents ! And Ethereum2.0 is coming and will be way more clean !

# WebApp :
The WebApp is the interface between the user and the decentralised stockage of you documents. It allows you to add, update and delete your documents at will with only you in charge. It uses an api in C# to do the login process and then send the request to the Blockchain.

# Encryption :
Worry about the eventuality of loosing your hardware key ? Donâ€™t worry, we have considered this case for you, we have encrypted the private key !
We use Elgamal encryption, an asymetrical encryption system. To generate your key pair, a password will be choosen by the user at the moment of the password creation. The generated keys will be stored as hashed values on your hardware keys, and can only be accessed by your choosen password. 
We are the safest!!!!

# Login :
You feel uncomfortable when centralizing all your document/proof of identity in an unsecure app?
So do we.
That's why AuthGov provide you a safest way to loggin on the app: an hardware USB key. This key will allow you to connect on AuthGoov but also contains the key to undecrypted all your data. 


Need to prove your identity on a governement website ? 
Do it with AuthGoovAp ! Our hardaware keys can be plugged in any PC via USB, or read by an NFC on mobiles devices via an intergrated chip, you can access your ID card, passport and your electoral map, anywhere, in a very secure way.
