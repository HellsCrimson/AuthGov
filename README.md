# Technology:
In order to do so, we implemented:

# Storage

# WebApp

# Encryption

Worry about the time when you lose your flash disk ? Donâ€™t worry, we have considered this case for you, we have encrypted the private key !
We use Elgamal encryption  which is similar to RSA but safer than it. For the keys, the user will choose himself a four number private key, and we will generate automatically the public key for he / she and we will store it on the flash disk. 

We are the safest!!!!
# Loggin
You don't find it confortable to centralize all your document/proof of identity in an unsecure app?
Yes, me neither.
That's why AuthGoov provide you a safest way to loggin on the app: an hardware USB key. This key will allow you to connect on AuthGoov but also contains the key to undecrypted all your data. 


Need to prove your identity ? 
Do it with AuthGoovAp ! After loggin it with the chip located on your hardware key, you can access your ID card, passport and your electoral map.
